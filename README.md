# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic **Snake Game** implemented in **Python** using the **Turtle** graphics module. The player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself. Built as a fun project to reinforce fundamental programming concepts like game loops, OOP, and real-time interaction in Python.
